Try out the latest development version of ratify in Kubernetes through Gatekeeper as the admission controller.

## Prerequisites

- Any Kubernetes cluster (we use minikube in this tutorial)
- [Helmfile](https://helmfile.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#installation) v1.0.0 or higher

If you prefer manual installation without helmfile automation, please refer to [ratify-quickstart-manual.md](quickstarts/quickstart-manual.md) for step-by-step instructions.

### Step 1: Install Gatekeeper, Ratify, and Constraints

```bash
helmfile sync -f 'git::https://github.com/notaryproject/ratify.git@dev.helmfile.yaml.gotmpl'
```

### Step 2: See Ratify in action

Once the installation is completed, you can test the deployment of an image that is signed using Notation solution.

- This will successfully create the pod `demo`

```bash
kubectl run demo --image=ghcr.io/deislabs/ratify/notary-image:signed -n default
kubectl get pods demo -n default
```

Optionally you can see the output of the pod logs via: `kubectl logs demo`

- Now deploy an unsigned image

```bash
kubectl run demo1 --image=ghcr.io/deislabs/ratify/notary-image:unsigned -n default
```

You will see a deny message from Gatekeeper denying the request to create it as the image doesn't have any signatures.

```bash
Error from server (Forbidden): admission webhook "validation.gatekeeper.sh" denied the request: [ratify-constraint] Artifact failed verification: ghcr.io/deislabs/ratify/notary-image@sha256:17490f904cf278d4314a1ccba407fc8fd00fb45303589b8cc7f5174ac35554f4, 
report: {"artifactReports": null, "succeeded": false}
```

You just validated the container images in your k8s cluster!

### Step 3: Uninstall
```bash
helmfile destroy --skip-charts -f 'git::https://github.com/notaryproject/ratify.git@dev.helmfile.yaml.gotmpl'
```

### Notes

If the image reference provided resolves to an OCI Index or a Docker Manifest List, validation will occur ONLY at the index or manifest list level. Ratify currently does NOT support image validation based on automatic platform selection. For more information, [see this issue](https://github.com/notaryproject/ratify/issues/101).
