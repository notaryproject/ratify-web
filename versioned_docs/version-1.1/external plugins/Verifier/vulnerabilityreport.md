# Vulnerability Report

This document outlines how Ratify can be used to verify vulernability reports. The `vulnerabilityreport` verifier is added as a plugin to the Ratify verification framework. Currently the vulnerability report verifier supports the following report types:

- Reports attached to the subject image as a referrer artifact
- Reports in SARIF format
- Reports generated by [Trivy](https://aquasecurity.github.io/trivy/v0.47/) or [Grype](https://github.com/anchore/grype)

## Example Scenario 

Alice has a Kubernetes cluster. She wants to enable vulnerability report verification. In particular, she wants to make sure all container images used in K8s resources have at least one valid vulnerability report attached to the image. She only wants to consider the latest vulnerability report that was generated. The report must:
- be in SARIF format
- generated from Trivy or Grype
- created less than 24 hours ago
- has no HIGH or CRITICAL severity level vulnerabilities in the report
- does not contain the log4shell CVE 

### Recording

[![asciicast](https://asciinema.org/a/622368.svg)](https://asciinema.org/a/622368)

### Walkthrough

First, only follow the first step of the [manual quickstart](../../quickstarts/quickstart-manual.md), which installs Gatekeeper on the cluster. 

Second, install Ratify with the vulnerability report verifier enabled and configured.

```bash
helm repo add ratify https://notaryproject.github.io/ratify
helm install ratify \
    ratify/ratify --atomic \
    --namespace gatekeeper-system \
    --set featureFlags.RATIFY_CERT_ROTATION=true \
    --set vulnerabilityreport.enabled=true \
    --set vulnerabilityreport.maximumAge="24h" \
    --set vulnerabilityreport.disallowedSeverities="{"high","critical"}" \
    --set vulnerabilityreport.denylistCVEs={"CVE-2021-44228"}
```

Next, install the vulnerability report constraint template and constraint. The Constraint Template defines the policy "all container images used in K8s resources have at least one valid most recent vulnerability report attached to the image and the report has a valid Notary Project signature"

```shell
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/deislabs/ratify/23b143d07a53fd61557703c9836e486353959530/library/vulnerability-report-validation/template.yaml

kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/deislabs/ratify/v1.1.0/library/vulnerability-report-validation/samples/constraint.yaml
```

An image `myregistry.io/vuln/alpine:3.18.2` is scanned and a vulnerability report is generated. A reference artifact is generated:
1. Use Trivy to scan `myregistry.io/vuln/alpine:3.18.2` and output a report in SARIF format
    ```shell
    trivy image -q -f sarif myregistry.io/vuln/alpine:3.18.2 > trivy-sarif.json
    ```
2. A tool such as `oras` is used to package, attach, and then push the report to registry
    - `artifact-type` MUST be `application/sarif+json`
    - `org.opencontainers.image.created` annotation with RFC3339 formatted current timestamp
    ```shell
    oras attach \
        --artifact-type application/sarif+json \
        --annotation "org.opencontainers.image.created=$(date -u +'%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ')" \
        myregistry.io/vuln/alpine:3.18.2 \
        trivy-sarif.json
    ```

The resulting image will have a single SARIF vulnerability report artifact attached:

```shell
> oras discover myregistry.io/vuln/alpine:3.18.2 -o tree
myregistry.io/vuln/alpine@sha256:25fad2a32ad1f6f510e528448ae1ec69a28ef81916a004d3629874104f8a7f70
└── application/sarif+json
    └── sha256:6170ef41e5a7c7088f86e3bc6b9c370cf97e613f7c7e359628c0119ec7d3d5f4
```

Finally we will attempt to deploy our test image `myregistry.io/vuln/alpine:3.18.2`. We expect this to FAIL since our vulnerability report indicates multiple HIGH and CRITICAL level severities:

```shell
> kubectl run vuln-alpine-image -n default --image=myregistry.io/vuln/alpine:3.18.2
Error from server (Forbidden): admission webhook "validation.gatekeeper.sh" denied the request: [vulnerability-report-validation-constraint] Subject failed verification: myregistry.io/vuln/alpine@sha256:25fad2a32ad1f6f510e528448ae1ec69a28ef81916a004d3629874104f8a7f70
```

Taking a look at the Ratify logs reveals the failing report:

```json

## Vulnerability Report with Signature Validation

Alice has a Kubernetes cluster. She wants to enable vulnerability report verification. In particular, she wants to make sure all container images used in K8s resources have the most recent vulnerability report attached to the image be valid. The report must:
- be in SARIF format
- generated from Trivy or Grype
- created less than 24 hours ago
- has no HIGH or CRITICAL severity level vulnerabilities in the report
- does not contain the log4shell CVE 

Furthermore, the most recent report being validated must have a verified Notary Project signature attached to it.

First, follow the first step of the [manual quickstart](../../quickstarts/quickstart-manual.md) to install Gatekeeper. 

Second, install Ratify with the vulnerability report verifier enabled and configured. The notation verifier must also be configued and cert provided. Here, we will assume the report is signed using the quickstart image's signing key.

```bash
helm repo add ratify https://notaryproject.github.io/ratify
# download the notary verification certificate
curl -sSLO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/deislabs/ratify/main/test/testdata/notation.crt
helm install ratify \
    ratify/ratify --atomic \
    --namespace gatekeeper-system \
    --set featureFlags.RATIFY_CERT_ROTATION=true \
    --set-file notationCerts={./notation.crt} \
    --set vulnerabilityreport.enabled=true \
    --set vulnerabilityreport.maximumAge="24h" \
    --set vulnerabilityreport.notaryProjectSignatureRequired=true \
    --set vulnerabilityreport.disallowedSeverities="{"high","critical"}" \
    --set vulnerabilityreport.denylistCVEs={"CVE-2021-44228"}
```

Next, install the vulnerability report constraint template and constraint. The Constraint Template defines the policy "all container images used in K8s resources have at least one valid most recent vulnerability report attached to the image and the report has a valid Notary Project signature"

```shell
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/deislabs/ratify/23b143d07a53fd61557703c9836e486353959530/library/vulnerability-report-validation/template.yaml | sed 's/require_signature := false/require_signature := true/' | kubectl apply -f -

kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/deislabs/ratify/v1.1.0/library/vulnerability-report-validation/samples/constraint.yaml
```

An image `myregistry.io/vuln/alpine:3.18.2` is scanned and a vulnerability report is generated. A reference artifact is generated:
1. Use Trivy to scan `myregistry.io/vuln/alpine:3.18.2` and output a report in SARIF format
    ```shell
    trivy image -q -f sarif myregistry.io/vuln/alpine:3.18.2 > trivy-sarif.json
    ```
2. A tool such as `oras` is used to package, attach, and then push the report to registry
    - `artifact-type` MUST be `application/sarif+json`
    - `org.opencontainers.image.created` annotation with RFC3339 formatted current timestamp
    ```shell
    oras attach \
        --artifact-type application/sarif+json \
        --annotation "org.opencontainers.image.created=$(date -u +'%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ')" \
        myregistry.io/vuln/alpine:3.18.2 \
        trivy-sarif.json
    ```
3. Use [`notation`](https://notaryproject.dev/) to sign the report
  ```shell
  report_digest=$(oras discover myregistry.io/vuln/alpine:3.18.2 -o json | jq .manifests[0].digest | tr -d \")
  notation sign myregistry.io/vuln/alpine@$report_digest
  ```

The resulting image will have a single SARIF vulnerability report artifact attached with Notary Project signature attached to the report:

```shell
> oras discover myregistry.io/vuln/alpine:3.18.2 -o tree
myregistry.io/vuln/alpine@sha256:25fad2a32ad1f6f510e528448ae1ec69a28ef81916a004d3629874104f8a7f70
└── application/sarif+json
    └── sha256:6170ef41e5a7c7088f86e3bc6b9c370cf97e613f7c7e359628c0119ec7d3d5f4
        └── application/vnd.cncf.notary.signature
            └── sha256:1f89580da5b08d943ed0a403f1629928a21aec3f51bce7c38b0bea8b187b83a7
```

Finally we will attempt to deploy our test image `myregistry.io/vuln/alpine:3.18.2`. We expect this to FAIL since our vulnerability report indicates multiple HIGH and CRITICAL level severities:

```shell
> kubectl run vuln-alpine-image -n default --image=myregistry.io/vuln/alpine:3.18.2
Error from server (Forbidden): admission webhook "validation.gatekeeper.sh" denied the request: [vulnerability-report-validation-constraint] Subject failed verification: myregistry.io/vuln/alpine@sha256:25fad2a32ad1f6f510e528448ae1ec69a28ef81916a004d3629874104f8a7f70
```

Taking a look at the Ratify logs reveals the failing report. Note how the report includes a successful Notary Project signature verification.

  ]
}

```

## Passthrough Mode

There may be scenarios where the current vulnerability report rules enforced are not sufficient. Passthrough mode allows for the entire contents of the vulnerability report to be outputted in the resulting verifier report. Users can then apply custom Rego parsing the report contents either in the built-in [Ratify Rego Policy](https://ratify.dev/docs/1.0/reference/crds/policies#regopolicy) provider or Gatekeeper's `ConstraintTemplate`.

To enable, set the `passthrough` parameter to `true` in the verifier configuration (JSON config or CRD). 

> Note: ALL other configuration parameters for the `vulnerabilityreport` verifier are NOT considered, EXCEPT for the `maximumAge` parameter.
